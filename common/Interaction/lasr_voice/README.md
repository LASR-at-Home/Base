running the sound play dependencies e.g. recordings, demands running the sound play node
This is done by typing the following
```commandline
roslaunch sound_play soundplay_node.launch
```
testing if sound play is set up correctly can be done by running
```commandline
roslaunch sound_play test.launch 
```
